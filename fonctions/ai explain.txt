It looks like this script is designed to take in a mathematical function as input, process it, and then output the "table of signs" for that function.

The script starts by defining a main() function, which prompts the user for input and then calls other functions to process and display the table of signs. The proccess_input() function takes the input function and the operator (either ">" or "<") as arguments, and it returns a list of the terms in the function and the operator. The function first splits the input function into a list of individual terms, and then it processes each term to determine its coefficient and constant value. If the term has a square root or power operator, these are also calculated. If the term has a fraction, this is also simplified. Finally, the coefficient and constant value are used to create a new term in the form "x+constant_value", which is added to the list of terms. The function then returns this list of terms and the operator.

The tableau_de_signes() function takes the list of terms and the operator as arguments, and it displays the table of signs for the function. The function first creates a list of the constant values for each term in the function, and then it sorts this list in ascending order. It then iterates through the list of constant values and determines the sign of the function for each value based on the operator and the values of the terms. The function then displays the results in a table, with the constant values in the left column and the signs in the right column.
